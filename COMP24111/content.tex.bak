\section{Machine Learning}

Machine Learning is the creation of self-configuring data structures that allow
a computer to do things that would be classed as `intelligent' if a human did
it.

Machine learning has been around in it's infancy since the 40's, where reasoning
and logic were first studied by Claude Shannon and Kurt Godel. Steady progress
was made with lots of funding through until the 70's, where people then realised
AI was very hard, causing funding to dry up, and the term `AI Winter' to be
coined.

In the 80's people started to look at biologically inspired algorithms such as
neural networks and genetic algorithms, and there is more investment. This leads
to the field of AI diverging into many other fields such as Computer Vision,
NLP, Machine Learning etc. In the 00's, ML begins to overlap with statistics,
and the first {\it useful} applications emerge.

\section{Nearest Neighbour Classifier}

The Nearest Neighbour (NN) classifier is a simple implementation of a machine
learning algorithm. We can give it a set of training data with each point
labelled by a class, and then give it another datapoint, and that datapoint will
be classified according to the data.

The premise is that you plot all the points of the training data on a graph, and
when you want to classify another datapoint, you simply plot it on the existing
graph, and classify it by the classes of it's nearest neighbour(s).

% NN graph

One nice aspect of the NN classifier is that you can use it with as many
features as you like with little extra effort. A standard implementation of the
NN classifier might plot graphs in two dimensions, and thus will only be able to
classify data with two features. However, if you want to include more (or less)
features, you need to adjust the number of dimensions on your graph to match the
number of features you're including. Then when you find the nearest neighbours
on the graph, you find them in $n$-dimensional space rather than 2-dimensional
space, where $n$ is the number of dimensions on the graph.

\subsection{Finding the distance between two $n$-dimensional points}

In order to calculate which points in the training dataset are the nearest
neighbours to the new data point, we can calculate the {\it Euclidean Distance}
between the two points. In $n$ dimensions, this how:

\[
  d(p,q) = \sqrt{(p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2 + \dots + (p_{n-1} - q_{n-1})^2 + (p_n - q_n)^2}
\]

This is actually a very simple computation. If you're given two arrays (containing the coordinates of your points) of equal lengths, then you can do:

\begin{lstlisting}[label=scala_nn, caption=Scala Nearest Neighbour]
  val delta: Set[Double] = for {(a,b) <- coords1 zip coords2} yield math.pow(a-b, 2)
  val distance: Double = math.sqrt(delta.sum)
\end{lstlisting}

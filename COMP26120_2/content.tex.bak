\section{Keys and total orders}

It is often important to be able to implement some kind of comperator between
data items. This is often achieved in the from of a total order relation, which
has the following three properties:

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{Reflexive property} 
    $k \leq k$
  \item \textbf{Antisymmetric property}
    $(k_1 \leq k_2 \wedge k_2 \leq k_1) \implies k_1 = k_2$
  \item \textbf{Transitive property} 
    $k_1 \leq k_2 \wedge k_2 \leq k_3 \implies k_1 \leq k_3$
\end{description}

A comperator that has the above three properties defines a linear ordering
relationship between data items. This means there will be a smallest item
$k_{min}$, where $k_{min} \leq K$ for all $K$ in the collections of data items.

\section{Trees}

\subsection{Definition}

A tree is an abstract data type for hierarchical storage of information. Each
element in a tree has a parent element, and zero or more children elements. The
node at the top of the tree is called the root.

A sub-tree is the tree consisting of all the descendents of a child of a tree,
including the child itself.

A tree is said to be \textit{ordered} if a linear ordering relation is defined
for the children of each node, that is to say that if we wanted to, we could
apply this relation to sort the children into an ordered list.

A binary tree is one where each node can have a maximum of two children. A
binary tree is \textit{proper} if each node as two (or zero) children. At each
level of a binary tree, the number of nodes in that level is at most $2^d$ where
$d$ is the level of the tree (starting from 0).

The depth of a node is the number of ancestors of the node excluding the node
itself.

% TODO: mention that recursive algorithms can be slooooowww for large trees
%       compared to an equivalent iterative algorithm. 

\subsection{Tree algorithms}

\subsubsection{Depth of a node}

The depth of a node in a tree is the number of ancestors of the node, excluding
the node itself.

\begin{javacode}
  int depth() {
    if(parent == null) { 
      // We've got no parent; we are the root!
      return 0;
    } else {
      return parent.depth() + 1;
    }
  }
\end{javacode}

This algorithm runs in $O(n)$ time and space, since it's dependent on the depth
of the tree, and is recursive.

\marginpar{Note that recursive algorithms always use space proportional to the
number of times they have recursed, since (unless tail recursion is used), each
recursion will use a stack frame.}

\subsection{Height of a tree}

A simple way to find the height of the tree, would be to iterate over every node
(maybe using a tree traversal algorithm mentioned in section~\ref{tree-
traversal}), and find the depth of each, keeping track of the maximum depth.
This would be a $O(n^2)$ algorithm.

A better approach is to use a recursive definition, and start from the root of
the tree. We can find the height of all of the child nodes, and return that plus
one.

\begin{javacode}
  int height() {
    if(children.size() == 0) return 0;
    else {
      int max = 0;
      for(Tree child : children) {
        int childHeight = child.height();
        if(childHeight > max) max = childHeight;
      }
      return max + 1;
    }
  }
\end{javacode}

\subsubsection{Tree traversal}

There are two different traversal schemes for trees; pre-order and post-order.
Each visits the elements in the tree in a different order. The following code
shows two different map functions, iterating in pre-order and then post order.

\begin{ccode}
  void mapPreOrder(Tree* root, void (*action)(Tree*)) {
    action(root);
    for(int i = 0; i < root->numChildren; i++) {
      root->children[i].mapInOrder(action);
    }
  }
  void mapPostOrder(Tree* root, void (*action)(Tree*)) {
    for(int i = 0; i < root->numChildren; i++) {
      root->children[i].mapInOrder(action);
    }
    action(root);
  }
\end{ccode}

You can also iterate in-order if your tree is a binary tree, you visit the left
child first, call the function on the current node, and then visit the right
child.

All the traversal algorithms take $O(n)$ time. 

\subsection{Tree datastructures}

There are two \textit{main} ways to store binary trees in memory; using a list
of nodes (in a heap style), or by using a linked datastructure, having nodes
point to other nodes.

\subsubsection{Using a vector based datastructure for trees}

In the vector (list/array/whatever you want to call it) style, the root of the
tree is stored at the start of the array. To calculate the index of the left
child of a node, you multiply the index of the current node by two. To find the
index of the right child of a node, you multiply its index by two and add one.
This numbering function is known as \textit{level numbering}, and can be
implemented like so:

\begin{ccode}
  int left(int n) { return 2 * n; }
  int right(int n) { return (2 * n) + 1; }
\end{ccode}

The running times of a vector-backed binary tree are good. Iteration can be done
in $O(n)$ time with a low overhead, swapping elements is $O(1)$ as is replacing
them.

\subsubsection{Using linked nodes to form a tree datastructure}

The trouble with using a vector datastructure, is you need to initialise an area
of memory equal to $2^{depth} \times sizeof(Tree)$. This means that for deep
trees, you will be wasting very large amounts of memory. This is a rather
extreme case of a memory-speed trade off.

In a linked data structure, each node points to all of its children. A really
simple example of a binary tree one could be:

\begin{javacode}
  public class Tree<T> {
    public Tree<T> left, right;
    public T value;
  }
\end{javacode}

If wanted to represent general (i.e. not binary) trees, we would have to modify
the datastructure so that we could have any number of children:

\begin{javacode}
  public class Tree<T> {
    public List<Tree<T>> children;
    public T value;
  }
\end{javacode}

\section{Priority Queues}

A priority queue is a datastructure capable of ordering items based on some
associated key. The two most important operations implemented on it are
\texttt{insertItem{priority, item}} and \texttt{removeMin()}.

Priority queues are the basis of some sorting algorithms, for example heap sort,
smooth sort, selection sort and insertion sort. The different type of sort
depends on how the priority queue is implemented. To sort a list using this
method, add all the items to the priority queue in any order, fill up the array
again in the order that the elements come out of the queue.

\begin{javacode}
  public <T implements Comparable<T>> List<T> sort(List<T> list) {
    PriorityQueue<T> pQueue = new PriotityQueue<T>();
    while(!list.isEmpty()) {
      pQueue.add(list.remove(0));
    }
    while(pQueue.isEmpty()) {
      list.add(pQueue.poll());
    }
    return list;
  }
\end{javacode}

\subsection{Heaps}

Priority queues are often implemented using a heap as the backing datastructure.
A heap is a binary tree that stores a collection of values. The type of values
stored by the heap must have a total order relationship, since otherwise, the
heap cannot be constructed correctly. The two properties that make heaps
different from normal binary trees are:

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{Heap order property}:\\
    For every node $v$ in the tree, the value of $v$ is greater than or equal to
    the value of its parent. The only exception is the root, since that doesn't 
    have a parent.

    This means that if you start from the root, and move towards any leaf, then
    the nodes you encounter will be in a non-decreasing order. It also means 
    that the minimum key is at the root.
  \item \textbf{Complete binary tree property}:\\
    This means that if heap has a depth of $d$, then all levels of the tree from
    $0$ to $d-1$ must be completely full (i.e. they have $2^{level}$ nodes in),
    and the last level is filled up from left to right with the remaining
    elements.
\end{description}

There are no operations on a heap run that in worse than $O(log(n))$ time. The
operations are performed in a time proportional to the height of the tree rather
than the number of its elements.

\subsubsection{Insertion}

To store a new element in the heap, we add a new node to the heap at the next
availible position (the last position in the tree). If the heap is backed by an
array, then the index of the array will ne $n+1$, where $n$ is the current heap
size.

After we've inserted the new element we must check that the heap properties
aren't violated. The \textit{complete binary tree} property will be fine since
we added the element at the end of the array (which is always the last element
in the current level, or the first element in a new level), but the \textit{heap
order} property may be violated.

To maintain the \textit{heap order} property, we need to `bubble' the newly
inserted item up the heap until the property is restored. This is achieved by
comparing the key of the newly inserted node $n$ with its parent $p$. If $k(u)
\gt k(p)$, then they are swapped around (which is literally caused by indexes
the two items in the array). In the worst case, you would insert the (new)
smallest element into the heap, and the element would bubble all the way up to
the top, taking $log(n)$ time. This is called `up heap bubbling'.

\subsubsection{Removal}

If we want to remove the smallest element from the heap (as is required for a
priority queue), then that will be the root element of the heap. However, if we
just removed that element, then we would have two binary trees not one (a left
and a right tree).

Instead, we move the last element in the array into the first element, and
return the original first element (the last element is deleted). The
\textit{complete tree} property is now satisfied again. Now we have the element
previously at the bottom of the heap at the top, so we need to move it into a
position that will satisfy the  \textit{heap order} property.

To restore the \textit{heap order} property, we must `down heap bubble' the
rooot element. If the root element is the only node, then the property is
already satisfied. If the only child is on the left, then let $s$ be the left
child, and otherwise, let $s$ be the smallest (direct) child of the root node.

If $k(root) \gt k(s)$ then the heap order property is restored by swapping $r$
and $s$. You continue down the tree, swapping what was the route node until no
violation of the heap order property occurs. Since we may have to move all the
way down the tree from root to leaf, the runtime of this is also $O(log(n))$.

\subsubsection{Heap sort}

Since insertion and removal are both $O(log(n))$, and we're inserting $n$
elements, and then removing $n$ elements, then the runtime of a heap sort will
be $n \times n \log(n)$. Since constant factors are removed from the Big-O
notation, then the runtime is $O(n \log(n))$. This is a large improvement from
selection and insertion sort that take $n^2$ time. If the sequence was
implemented as an array, then the sort can be done in place too!

\section{Dictionaries and Hash Tables}

% This section is poorly explained

In a dictionary, the user assigns keys to elements, and the keys can be used to
look up elements in the datastructure (also known as a map in other languages
such as \texttt{java}). Dictionaries can be unordered, or ordered. When keys are
unique, then the dictionary is referred to as an associated store.

If the keys are unique, then a good way to implement the dictionary is a hash
table. Here, the key is hashed into an integer using a hashing function. The
result is used as the index of an array of `buckets'.

Each bucket stores a collection of values that have the same hashed key.
Ideally, each bucket will hold one element. This is easy to ensure for some
data, for example, if we had a Hash Table of the integers from 0-50, then we
could use the integer as the index to an array of fifty elements. In general
though, it is not possible to ensure that no collisions will occur, and one
bucket will probably end up with multiple elements. In this case, we need a
collision resolution strategy.

If we have a collision resolution strategy, then we don't need to have an array
that is as big as the number of items we're going to hold. We could just rely on
the collision resolution strategy to let us have a smaller array and therefore
need less contigous memory space. Even if we do have the memory to spare, its
wasteful to have a massive array if we're only going to store a few items in
there.

If our hash function produces integers as indexes that are greater than the
number of buckets, then we can either take the modulus of that number by the
size of the array, or use the MAD method:

\[
  hash = |ak + b| mod N
\]

Where $N$ is a prime, and $a,b$ are random non-negative integers such that $a
mod N \neq 0$. The MAD (Multiply Add and Divide) method means the chance of a
collision is $\frac{1}{N}$.

\subsection{Collision handleing}

There are different collision handeling schemes, and each has its own benifits
and drawbacks. Here are just three:

\begin{description}
  \item \textbf{Seperate chaining}:\\
    This is most often implemented using a Linked List for the buckets.
    Basically, when you want to add an item to the bucket, you just append it to
    the existing Linked List of items.
  \item \textbf{Open addressing}:\\
    In this strategy, if the index of the hash value is already occupied, then
    the buckets are examined in some sequence (the easiest is linear probing,
    which just looks at consecutive elements in the array), until a free slot
    is found.
  \item \textbf{Double hashing}:\\
    Here, a second hashing algorithm is used to find an alternative slot when 
    the first shows a collision. If we did $j$ attempts to find a new slot, the
    new index would be $hash1 + (j \times h(key))$, where $h$ is the second
    hashing algorithm.
\end{description}

Different collision resolution schemes exhibit different performance as the load
factor changes. The load factor is the number of entries divided by the number
of buckets.

If the load factor becomes too high, then we could \textit{rehash} the table.
This involves increaseing the number of buckets, and re-inserting all the
elements currently in the table so that they are distributed according to the
new size of the array.

\subsubsection{Probing}

Probing is part of the open addressing collision resolution strategy. Linear
probing is easiest, you just walk through the array one by one until you find an
empty slot. Quadratic probing is harder, the next index to try and insert the
element into is found using an equation such as $|index + j^2| mod N$, where $j$
is the $j^{th}$ attempt at finding a slot.

Removing elements from a open addressed hash table is slightly more complicated,
but can be resolved by marking elements as `deactivated' rather than removing
them.

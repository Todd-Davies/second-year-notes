  What is the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm?
}{
  $O(E + V\log(v))$

  What's the running time of a depth first search when the graph is an adjacency
  matrix?
}{
  $O(V^2)$ since finding neighbours takes $O(V)$ time.

  list?
}{
  $O(V + E)$

  How do we insert an element into a heap?
}{
  First, you insert it at the next space in the heap (last element of current
  row, or a new row), then you keep swapping it with its parent if the parent
  is larger than it.
